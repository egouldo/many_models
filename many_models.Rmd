Let's start simple, highlighting some basic tools that we will need later: chiefly, tools from the broom package.

# A tidy workflow for working with one model



## What are tidy dataframes / tidy data?

Hadley (Wickham, 2014) puts this well: 

> "tidy datasets provide a standardised way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning)"

Appearance layout of tidy data:

- Each variable is represented by a single column
- each observation has its own row
- each value has its own cell

## What's in a model? Sweeping up with broom

Regressions are messy in R... 

```{r fit-single-mod}
lm_car <- lm(mpg ~ wt + qsec, data = mtcars)
summary(lm_car) # messy output
```

1. Extracting coefficients takes multiple steps `data.frame(coef(summary(lm_car)))`
2. Information is stored in rownames: combining models requires wrangling
3. Column names are annoying: must access with `$“Pr(>|t|)”`, and is converted to `Pr...t..`
4. Information computed in the print method is not stored, e.g. F-stat and p-values

```{r load-broom}
# Enter broom:
library(broom)
```

Broom generates tidy model summaries, turning statistical models into tidy data-frames.


- `broom::tidy` model component-level statistics: coefficient estimates, SE, etc.
- `broom::augment` observation-level, fitted values, residuals etc.
- `broom::glance` - model-level statistics: e.g. ${R}^{2}$ , AIC, deviance etc.

```{r demo-broom-functions}
lm_car %>% broom::tidy() # one observation per model term
lm_car %>% broom::augment() # one observation per observation in the original data, new columns preceded with "."
lm_car %>% broom::glance() # one observation per model
```

## Why do we want tidy model summaries?

- The data manipulation and reshaping is done for you, by `broom`. You can focus on understanding your model and your data, rather than on writing code.
- Tidy data works with tidy tools: we can easily visualise broom's output with `ggplot`, e.g. plotting the model in dataspace, generate coefficient plots, survival curves, etc.
- Working with MANY models: tidy model outputs can be easily combined, and compared.

# When do we fit multiple models?

1. Exploring the space of all possible models and their relative merits: E.g. for a given model family, you can explore different forms, for example, for a linear model we could generate all models with main effects.
2. Varying model settings: e.g. systematically alter the tuning parameters to observe the result. 
3. Fitting the same model to different datasets: cross-validation, bootstrapping, simulating data, sensitivity analyses, etc.
4. Finding global optima - e.g. when model fitting might not converge to global optimum, you can have a collection of models generated from multiple random starts.
5. Fitting many simple models ot smaller sub-groups of your data rather than a single complex model to the whole dataset

## Computational challenges of fitting many models

We can distill the above tasks into two primary workflows:

1. When you have a single model that you want to repeatedly fit to different sub-sets of the larger data set.
2. When you have a selection of different models you want to fit to the same piece of data repeatedly.

You could solve this computationally by fitting many models using for-loops. Or, when fitting fewer models, you can store your models and their resultant outputs as objects in your global environment.

- Loops: slow, *cumbersome* to write
- Intermediate objects: clutter up your global environment, must keep mental-track of each object
- For either method, you still need to extract the desired model outputs from each fitted model, wrangle them, combine them, perhaps wrangle some more, before you can analyse and/or visualise your many models simultaneously.

But there are a suite of tools out there that get the job done more efficiently (both in terms of computational efficiency, and in terms of the actual code that you write)!

## A fresh approach: list-columns and nested data frames



# What packages are we working with and what do they do?





## A workflow for same model, many pieces:

What do we need? (getting around the loop / many objects conundrum)

1. dplyr: create new columns / variables, amend existing ones
2. tidyr: nested data with list columns - method of storing ... facilitates applying 
3. purrr: map functions, map nested dataframes to the modeling function or to broom function

```{r load-libs}
library(glm2) # fit models, glms
library(dplyr) # data manipulation
library(tidyr) # For reshaping dataframes, specifically nesting
library(purrr) # For applying functions to nested dataframes
library(ggplot2) # good lookin' plots
```

### List-columns


# Broom and nesting
Each row is:

- tidy - a coefficient - nesting required
- augment - an observation from the original data, adds new cols to the original data, such as fitted values - nesting required
- glance- one row per model - nesting not necessarily required
