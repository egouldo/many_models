Let's start simple, highlighting some basic tools that we will need later: chiefly, tools from the broom package.

# A tidy workflow for working with one model



## What are tidy dataframes / tidy data?

Hadley (Wickham, 2014) puts this well: 

> "tidy datasets provide a standardised way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning)"

Appearance layout of tidy data:

- Each variable is represented by a single column
- each observation has its own row
- each value has its own cell

## What's in a model? Sweeping up with broom

Regressions are messy in R... 

```{r fit-single-mod}
lm_car <- lm(mpg ~ wt + qsec, data = mtcars)
summary(lm_car) # messy output
```

1. Extracting coefficients takes multiple steps `data.frame(coef(summary(lm_car)))`
2. Information is stored in rownames: combining models requires wrangling
3. Column names are annoying: must access with `$“Pr(>|t|)”`, and is converted to `Pr...t..`
4. Information computed in the print method is not stored, e.g. F-stat and p-values

```{r load-broom}
# Enter broom:
library(broom)
```

Broom generates tidy model summaries, turning statistical models into tidy data-frames.


- `broom::tidy` model component-level statistics: coefficient estimates, SE, etc.
- `broom::augment` observation-level, fitted values, residuals etc.
- `broom::glance` - model-level statistics: e.g. ${R}^{2}$ , AIC, deviance etc.

```{r demo-broom-functions}
lm_car %>% broom::tidy() # one observation per model term
lm_car %>% broom::augment() # one observation per observation in the original data, new columns preceded with "."
lm_car %>% broom::glance() # one observation per model
```

## Why do we want tidy model summaries?

- The data manipulation and reshaping is done for you, by `broom`. You can focus on understanding your model and your data, rather than on writing code.
- Tidy data works with tidy tools: we can easily visualise broom's output with `ggplot`, e.g. plotting the model in dataspace, generate coefficient plots, survival curves, etc.
- Working with MANY models: tidy model outputs can be easily combined, and compared.

# Why do we fit multiple models?

- 'insight into the data and the relative merits of different models' removing the blindfold paper
- 'explore the process of fitting' - removing the blindfold paper
- explorign different parameters, methods, bootstrapping replicates, subgroup models, ensemble voting (andrew robinson slides)

Example instances, from:

1. Exploring the space of all possible models: E.g. for a given family, can explore different forms, like for a linear model we could generate all models with main efects. 
2. Varying model setting. Systematically alter the tuning parameters to observe the result. 
3. Fitting the same model to different datasets. cross-validation, bootstrapping, simulating, sensitivity analyses, etc.
4. Finding global optima - e.g. when model fitting might not converge to global optimum, you can have a collection of models generated from multiple random starts.

But difficult to visualise simultaneously. So we need to explore smaller sets of interesting models. We can narrow this down by first calculating descriptive statistics at multiple levels.

So this means that we often want to perform the same operation of different sets of data. How do we easily store, and access this data repetitively. Could program in for-loops, and write modelling functions. But there are a suite of tools out there that get the job done more efficiently (both in terms of computationally, and in terms of the actual code that you write).

# What packages are we working with and what do they do?

```{r load-libs}
library(glm2) # fit models, glms
library(dplyr) # data manipulation
library(tidyr) # For reshaping dataframes, specifically nesting
library(purrr) # For applying functions to nested dataframes
library(ggplot2) # good lookin plots, duh
```

I see two main workflows: 
1. when you have a single model that you want to repetitively fit to different pieces of the data.
2. when you have a selection of different models.

## A workflow for same model, many pieces:

What do we need?

1. dplyr: create new columns
2. tidyr: nested data with list columns
3. purrr: map functions, map nested dataframes to the modeling function or to broom function

### List-columns

Regular dataframes are essentially a collection of lists. So why cant we have a list of dataframes, say? Well we can 
using list-columns. `tidyr::nest()` nests dataframes into a single 'value' in the dataframe, which is essentially equivalent to a single element at the top-level of the list.

# Broom and nesting
Each row is:

- tidy - a coefficient - nesting required
- augment - an observation from the original data, adds new cols to the original data, such as fitted values - nesting required
- glance- one row per model - nesting not required
